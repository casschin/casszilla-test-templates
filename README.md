Casszilla Test Templates
============================

These templates are based on [Mozilla's test templates](https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates/), adding on some other basic functions that you might need to do to test web pages.

## Additional functions:
* Resizing browser window - good for testing responsive and adaptive designs
* Clicking elements
* Inputing text into fields
* Clearing text from fields
* Asserts for text (visible, not visible)
* Testing expected link destinations
* Get image src

The provided tests in `tests/test_home_page.py` show examples of how you might use these functions using the sample page provided in the `sample/` directory.
